## Submission Instructions

### Overview
LemonSlice is a community-driven food delivery platform that provides a mindful alternative to
DoorDash, Uber Eats, or GrubHub. The business model passes more profits on to the restaurants and
the drivers, and charges lower costs to consumers. Fundamentally this will operate much like the
other platforms do but will have a different business structure so that fees charged to consumers
and to restaurants are minimal and consumers are encouraged to tip generously to drivers
and to restaurant staff. The goal is to help drivers in the gig economy have a path towards
a regular and sustainable income, and to help restaurant staff earn a living wage. Consumers
benefit from lower fees and knowing that they are able to put their money directly into the pockets
of others in their community rather than the pockets of a corporation with huge profits. This is 
designed to appeal to the consumer who wants to do good with their purchases. The options for 
mindful, ethical consumption exist in many other industries (think AmazonSmile, for instance) 
but not yet in the food delivery arena. Our tagline for this business is Get Food, Do Good.

### Features
This part of the project focuses mostly on the consumer persona and is focused around how to place a food order:
Search Database of restaurant menus - a SQL database that is searchable and contains the menu items / data
User account creation - allows users to create an account, set a password, and set a delivery address
Edit / update user account - allows users to add a different delivery address and update profile information
Create order - allows users to add food items to a delivery list and submit the order
Add tip - allows users to finalize the order and add a tip for both delivery driver and restaurant staff
