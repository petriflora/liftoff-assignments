>Fun status update: I have the project working as an Angular / Gradle / SpringBoot / Tailwind CSS project! 
I have been able to successfully get all of the components integrated and it compiles and successfully 
shows a 'hello world' base project! I was so happy with the result that I created a base project package 
off the original repository so I can use it to start other projects instead of building it from scratch 
again because THAT was a pain.

Next up: an Angular crash course and starting to build out user stories.
