## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

Include at least 3 wireframes here, adding images or files to your repository as necessary. 
Format them as a bulleted/unordered list with links to the files.
-   I made a full wireframe model of what I hope to get done for this project using Figma. 
    The wireframes are all pulled into one PDF file. There are 17 pages of wireframes representing
    the main site features plus user account creation and update. This includes my colors, fonts,
    and other design features. Because there are so many pictures I didn't include them here.
